# Password Strength Checker

This is a simple Python-based project that analyzes a password and checks its strength based on multiple criteria such as length, digits, uppercase, lowercase, and special characters.

## Features
- Checks if the password contains:
  - Uppercase letters  
  - Lowercase letters  
  - Numbers  
  - Special characters  
- Gives a final strength result:
  - Weak  
  - Medium  
  - Strong  

## How It Works
The program evaluates each rule and assigns a score.  
Based on the total score, it displays the overall password strength.

## How to Run
1. Open the project folder  
2. Run the file:

```bash
python password_strength.py
